# Depression Level Prediction Project 


## Introdcution 
Welcome to the depression prediction system! This is a Microservice web app project based on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). After anwersing questions on my designed website, it will return your predicted current depression level (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Extremely Severe). This project used flask and Google App engine to develop the application with Machine Learning algorithms supporting the computations. The application also utilizes continuous integration and continoud delivery which allow us to make changes effectively.

#### My website to predit your depression level: https://delivery-338821.uc.r.appspot.com/
#### Welcome to have a try and ask for help if it shows you are in depression currently! 
data used for building the ML model: http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/dass/
## Demo 
#### See how to use and build up this application in the demo: https://youtu.be/0x8HoqtkaV4
## Website navigation 
When opening the website, there are total 36 questions you need to answer, which will take less than 5 minites. The default answer for each question is first one, and you need to circle the option that you agree most.

After finishing and submiiting your answers, it will return you precited depression level.
